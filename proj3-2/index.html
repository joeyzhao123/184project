        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).

        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>

        <p>
            For this project, we decided to implement mirror and glass materials as well as Depth of Field. For the mirror and glass materials, we largely just followed the math given to us in the assignment.
            For the DoF, we followed the steps listed out in the assignment and used the diagram given to visualize all the vectors. For debugging, the issues we had were syntax errors. It took us a while to find but staring at the code and looking through it over and over did the trick. The biggest bug we had was
            in fact missing the Vector3D text when initializing the vector, meaning we the compiler somehow accepted a tuple in place. There were many problems with this, and it took a while to find by combing through the code.

          With a ray depth of 0, we get what we used to get: all black. Only emission from the light is counted. With ray depth of 1 we see the objects but we do not see the mirror effect nor the glass effect from reflecting and refracting. 
          With 2, we can begin seeing reflections, and with 3, we can see refractions. Past a max ray depth of 3, there is no significant change to the appearances of the spheres, and it is clear that a ray depth of 100 does not change things much either.

            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
          If we think about a ray depth of 1, which is effectively 1 bounce, we aren't able to see reflections off other surfaces. Therefore, we need at least 2 bounces: we shoot one from the camera, it hits the mirror then reflects and bounces onto another surface. This then shows gives us the radiance from that bounce and we see a reflection. 
          For the glass, we need at least 3 bounces. It has to go into the glass, out of the glass, then bounce off something else to get that radiance, which gives us the effect of transparency. The reason why a max depth of 2 doesn't work well for glass is because we'd need to hit the light source right after refracting out, which doesn't give a transparency effect because
          the rest of the scene would never show through. We can see in our max depth 2 image that there's a small bright spot where the light is. Past these critical max ray depth points, we get more convincing images that converge to roughly what we see in max ray depth 100.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!

            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In a pinhole camera model, we received radiance from just one point. This means that we only need to find one ray. However, with a thin-lens model, we can recieve radiance from any point on the thin-lens, which means more radiance can arrive at our point in the image plan. We can sample our lens unifomrmly to get a good representation of the actual radiance that would arrive.

    <p>
      We mostly brainstormed together and we did parts 1 and 4 separately at first while reconvening to debug and confirm correctness. This is roughly what we did for the previous assignment too, and it worked out well.
